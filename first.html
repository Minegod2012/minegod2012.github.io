    <h2>Text can be enhanced in different ways. Here are some of those ways.</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;<b>Text can be made bold</b></p>
    <p><i>Text can be made italic</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;<ins>Text cannot be underlined in later versions of html because it looks like the text is a hyperlink</ins></p>
	<p>&nbsp;this is not true as i can very well do this <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hyperlink&oq=hyperlink&aqs=chrome..69i57.2347j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">example</a>

<p>You can add different styles to make a website engaging <b>eg.</b></p>
<p>text styles:--</p>
<p><h6>this is the h6 style</h6></p>
<p><h5>this is the h5 style</h5></p>
<p><h4>this is the h4 style</h4></p>
<p><h3>this is the h3 style</h3></p>
<p><h2>this is the h2 style</h2></p>
<p><h1>this is the h1 style</h1></p>
<p>it's kind of confusing as h1 is the biggest style and h6 is the smallest style</p>
